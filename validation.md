# Overview of validation of a release


A release is generated by assembling a `CiteLibrary` from source material, and exporting the library to CEX.

Validation proceeds by:

1. loading the CEX into a `CiteLibrary` object
2. configuring and applying a `MidProjectValidator`


## Prerequisites for project validation

The project validator by default needs the following structures and configuration:


1. extracted from the `CiteLibrary`:
    - a `TextRepository`
    - a `DseVector`
2. Configured in validation process:
    - an instance of `IIIFApi` or other implementation of `BinaryImageService`
    - a class implementing `MidOrthography`
    - a class implementing `MidMarkupReader`


## Optional extensions

Customized or project-specific validation can be added with instances of classes implementing the type-parameterized `TestResults` trait.
