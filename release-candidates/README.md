# Release candidates of the HMT archive (from 2019)


## Format

Since 2018, published releases of the HMT archive are automatically assembled into a single composite file.

Beginning in 2019, release candidates are published in this directory following the file naming convention

    hmt-YEAR_RELEASENUMBER_rcCANDIDATENUMBER.cex

The file `hmt-2019_1_rc1.cex`, for example, is release candidate 1 of the release 1 of 2019.


## Release notes
