# Published releases of the HMT archive (from 2018)


## Format

Beginning in 2018, published releases of the HMT archive are automatically assembled into a single composite file in the `releases-cex` directory named `hmt-RELEASE_ID.cex`.  This is accompanied by a complete list of automatically identified corrigenda in a markdown file named `hmt-RELEASE_ID-corrigenda.md` and by summaries of the contents of the publication in markdown files within a folder named `hmt-RELEASE_ID-summary`.


## Published releases


-  **2018b**:  indexes details and ultraviolet images of the Venetus A manuscript to individaul pages, and adds digital images of Comparetti's 1901 facsimile of the manuscript.
-  **2018a**:  *scholia* and *Iliad* text for *Iliad* 1-12 in the Venetus A.
